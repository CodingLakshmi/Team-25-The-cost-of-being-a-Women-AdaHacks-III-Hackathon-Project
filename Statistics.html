    <! Some of the information below is from the another website: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf, I used things from this website such as images, and data.>
    
    <p id = "subTag"> Overall, the pink taxes statistics say that women pay 42% more than men pay to taxes. In every industry, products for female consumers were more likely to cost more. Some examples are: Girls toys cost more 55 percent of the time, while boys’ toys cost more only 8 percent of the time. Women’s clothing cost more 40 percent of the time, while men’s clothing cost more 32 percent of the time. Girls’ clothing cost more 26 percent of the time, while boys’ clothing cost more 7 percent of the time. These are just some of the examples that show the difference between the price difference between womens' and men's products.</p>

    
    <p id = "subTag"> The differnces between the cost of the products of men and women is a lot. Some Examples are below:  </p>
    <img src = "Products_Cost1.JPG" alt = "Products Cost difference img1" id = "image2">

    </br> 
    </br>

    <p id = "subTag" > Based on the image you see above, we can tell that the same number of products of the same things cost different for men and women. For example, in the first image you see above, the total number of products is 292, however, the average cost for men and women is different. For women, the average cost is $307.38, but it isn't the same for men, the average cost for men is $285.85. So, for the same amount of products that you buy, there is a different price for men and women. Even if they are the same quality, same brand or the same product. Men get lower prices than women do, women pay more than men for every product that the buyer sells. </p>

    </br> 

    <p id = "subTag" > In the image above, you can see there are some more products that tell you about the differnt prices that women and men pay. Even though there are the same amount of products that both men and women buy, the total average cost that men and women are totally differnt. For example, there are a total of 122 products. But the average cost that women pays compared to men is so differnt. The average cost that women pays for these 122 items is $57.18 but for the same amount of items men pay only $50.75.  </p>

    <h2 id = "h2"> <u> Overall Conclusion </u> </h2>

    <p id = "subTag"> After comparing all of these graphs, you can see that there is a lot of gender discrimination in our society. Based on the graphs and charts that we see we can clearly see that women pay more than men for the same amount of products that they buy. This is very unfair for women, just because they are a differnt gender than men doesn't mean women have to pay more. In our Society there is a lot of gender discrimination hapenning, we need to stop this discrimination and give equal rights to both men and women. This is not the only problem we have about gender inquality, there are so many other things that women are facing gender inquality in. We hope this will not continue in for the future generations and hope that someone can stop this inequality that women are facing in the society. </p>
