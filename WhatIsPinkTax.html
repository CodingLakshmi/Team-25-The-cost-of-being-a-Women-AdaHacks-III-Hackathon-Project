	<p id="subTag"> What exactly is the pink tax? The pink tax is not actually a tax its the price difference between products targeted towards women
		versus products targeted towards men. It is something that has been around for years but it is only recently gaining more
		attention. The "women's" version on average costs 7% more than the men's products. Some women who know about the situation try to avoid the pink tax by buying men's product, which is a cheaper alternative to essentially the same products.
