  <p id="subTag"> The tampon tax is also a big issue which is a part of the pink tax. Unlike the pink tax, the tampon tax is the tax on menstrual products. Some personal care items such as dandruff shampoo and ChapStick are untaxable, however, menstrual products are still taxed in 36 states. Companies treat menstrual products as a luxury by pricing them so high. By doing this many people cannot afford these products putting their health at risk. <a href=https://www.sbh4all.org/2020/05/menstrual-products-should-be-free-periodt/> Nearly 50% of people who participated in a survey had to choose between food and menstrual products at least once in their life. </a>In addition to that, around 300,000 homeless people get their periods and don't have access to these "luxuries" because of their high prices. </p>
